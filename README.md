### Description:   
   
Pixel is a photo-sharing application where logged in users can upload, view, update, and delete their photos. Users can also create, view, update, and delete albums that store their photos. Users can add and remove photos from their albums by clicking the plus(+) and minus(-) symbols on the top right corner of their photos, as well as view the photos of other users via the "Your feed" tab. The photostream tab allows users to view their own photos, and the albums tab allows users to view their own albums. By clicking on the thumbnail of album a user can views the contents of that album, and by clicking on the thumbnail of a photo a user can view a full screen version of the photo, as well as who it was posted by. Pixel was heavily inspired by Flickr and is meant to be seen as a clone.
